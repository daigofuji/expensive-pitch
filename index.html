    <p><em>By <a href="http://daigofujiwara.com">Daigo Fujiwara</a></em></p>
    <p>The Boston Red Sox signed David Price to <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2015/12/01/red-sox-agree-deal-with-pitcher-david-price/Tsv1SM9yjAU1TncmXJpFUN/story.html">the record contract</a> of average $31 million a year this off-season. With his 3,388 pitches thrown by him last year, that comes out to be over $9,000 a pitch. Yikes, right? That got me thinking, who was the most economical and who's pitch was the most expensive? <a href="http://www.baseballhackday.com/boston/">2016 Basebal Hack Day</a> project.
