    <p>The Boston Red Sox signed David Price to the record contract of average $31million a year this off season. With his 3,388 pitches thrown by him last year, that comes out to be over $9,000 a pitch. Yikes, right? That got me thinking, who was the most economical and who's pitch was the most expensive? <a href="http://www.baseballhackday.com/boston/">2016 Basebal Hack Day</a> project.
